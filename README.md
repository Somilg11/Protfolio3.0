Protfolio 3.0 before 2.0 , yes, that's correct , it's not typo, cause I already started the 2.0 before 3.0 but that will take more than a month or so, cause It will be fulll fledged full stack protfolio website with admin dashboard, and for the time being, I need something responsive , as 1.0 is just display only not optimized.
